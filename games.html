<h2>Roblox Games</h2>

<p>This section covers information about Roblox games, including popular titles, game genres, and developer resources.</p><br>
<p>Roblox offers a wide variety of games across different genres, including action, adventure, role-playing, simulation, and more. Some of the most popular Roblox games include:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Adopt Me!: A role-playing game where players can adopt and care for virtual pets.</li>
    <li>Brookhaven: A social simulation game where players can explore a virtual town and interact with other players.</li>
    <li>Jailbreak: An action game where players can choose to be criminals or police officers in a city setting.</li>
    <li>MeepCity: A social game where players can customize their own virtual homes and interact with other players.</li><br>
    <br>
    Developers can also monetize their games through in-game purchases, advertising, and premium memberships, allowing them to earn revenue from their creations.<br>
    Unfortunately, Roblox has made some terrible updates to the games section, like removing the ability to create and play classic games, which was a huge blow to many developers who relied on classic games to create their games, and also removing the ability to use plugins in the classic studio, which was a huge blow to many developers who relied on plugins to create their games.<br>
    Roblox also made developers verify their ID to upload games, which was not well preserved by their community and led to many developers leaving the platform, and also made minors conduct face scans to unlock chat features, which was a huge invasion of privacy and led to many developers leaving the platform as well.<br>
    Many games are also dead beause many players of these games cannot chat, which decreased the amount of players in these classic games.<br>

    Here are some links to some of these games:<br>

    Here is what the meepcity logo looks like:<br>
    <img src="meepcity.jpg" alt="MeepCity Logo" width="400" height="300"><br>
    The meepcity logo is very unique since it has not really changed since the release of the game. I chose this one as I found it the most interesting.<br>

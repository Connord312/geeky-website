<h2>Roblox Studio</h2>

<p>Roblox Studio is the development environment where users can create and edit games for Roblox. It provides tools for building 3D environments, scripting gameplay mechanics, and designing user interfaces.</p><br>
Roblox Studio offers a wide range of features and capabilities, including:
<ol>
    <li>Building Tools: Users can create and manipulate 3D objects, terrain, and structures to design their game worlds.</li>
    <li>Scripting: Roblox Studio uses the Lua programming language, allowing developers to create complex gameplay mechanics and interactions.</li>
    <li>Testing and Debugging: Developers can test their games in real-time within the studio environment, making it easier to identify and fix issues.</li>
    <li>Collaboration: Roblox Studio supports team development, allowing multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously.</li><br>

    <br>
Currently, Roblox Studio continues to improve by releasing updates and improvements, making sure that developers have access to the latest features and tools to create an engaging and immersive games for the Roblox community.<br>
<br>
Roblox has unfortunately made some terrible updates to roblox studio, like removing the classic studio and replacing it with a new one that is not well received by the community, and also removing the ability to use plugins in the classic studio, which was a huge blow to many developers who relied on plugins to create their games.<br>
<br>
Roblox also made developers verify their ID to upload games, which was not well preserved by their community and led to many developers leaving the platform, and also made minors conduct face scans to unlock chat features, which was a huge invasion of privacy and led to many developers leaving the platform as well.<br>
Many games were left abandoned because of this.<br>
